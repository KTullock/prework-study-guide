# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to help me as a bootcamp student store all of my notes about coding that I will be learning over the next six months. This study guide contains notes for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Since I will be learning a vast amount of new information, I needed an organized place to store it all and will ideally lower my stress during this bootcamp course. To create this study guide, I had to learn and impliment the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

There, it will suggest which topic to study first. To open the DevTools console, you can right click anywhere on the webpage and select "Inspect".
